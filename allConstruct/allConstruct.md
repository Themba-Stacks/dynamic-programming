# AllConstruct

Write a function allConstruct(target, wordBank) that accepts a target string and an array of strings.

The function should return a 2d array containing all of the ways that the target can be constructed by concatenating elements of the wordbank array.
Each element of the 2D array should represent on combination that constructs the target.

You may reuse elements of wordBank as many times as needed.
